# Conway's Game of Life and Cellular Automata

## What is the project?

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton originally created by John Horton Conway in 1970. This game is played on a 2D grid of cells. Each cell can either be alive or dead.

## What problem does it solve?

The algorithm implements the following rules to visually showcase Conway's Game of life:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 

## Exceptional difficulties and solutions, if any.

The only difficulty I ran into was getting the Generation count to stop once the cell automaton finished.

## TODO list/wishlist. What do you want to add to it if you have more time?
